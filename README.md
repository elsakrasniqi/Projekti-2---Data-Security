Polybius Square Cipher with 2D array and Adjustable keys.

This program encrypts text and decrypts ciphered text using a 5 x 5 square. Using the 26 letters of English alphabet, one letter doesn't fit in a 5 Ã— 5 square, therefore two letters must be combined (J = I). We use a key to reorder the alphabet in the square, with the letters of the key being placed at the beginning and the remaining letters following it in alphabetical order. Our program offers you to choose if you would like to proceed with encryption or decryption and enter the desired key, after you are finished the program allows you to exit itself.
